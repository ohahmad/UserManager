## User Manager

A first attempt at integrating typescript into react with tests (also typed) written using jest / enzyme / jest fetch mock. A playground application which allows a user to be added (with some basic validation) and will display added users on the right hand side. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
